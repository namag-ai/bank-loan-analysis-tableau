# Bank Loan Analysis
Bank Loan Analysis using Excel, MySQL, Power BI and Tableau.

The goal of this project is to examine bank loan data in order to learn more about loan performance and customer behavior. The analysis utilizes various tools, such as Tableau for advanced analytics and reporting, Power BI for interactive data visualization, MySQL for database management, and Excel for data pretreatment.


## Data Sources
   * The dataset used for this analysis consists of historical bank loan data including: 
      1. information about customers
	  2. loan terms
      3. repayment status
      4. credit scores
      5. Loan Grade, and other relevant attributes. The data is sourced from the bank's internal database and stored in a MySQL database for easy access and manipulation.


## Analysis Process
   1. Data Preprocessing with Excel:
      * Cleaned and prepared the raw loan data in Excel, including removing duplicates, handling missing values,
        and formatting data types.
      * Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, outliers, and trends in the loan data.

   2. Database Management with MySQL:
      * Imported the preprocessed loan data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval.
      * Created SQL queries to perform data transformations, aggregations, and calculations as required for the 
        analysis.

   3. Interactive Visualization with Power BI:
      * Connected Power BI to the MySQL database to import the loan data.
      * Designed interactive dashboards and reports to visualize key metrics such as loan portfolio 
        composition, delinquency rates, and customer demographics.
      * Implemented slicers, filters, and drill-down functionalities for users to explore the data dynamically.

   4. Advanced Analytics and Reporting with Tableau:
      * Leveraged Tableau for more advanced analytics, including predictive modeling, cohort analysis, and 
        geographical mapping of loan performance.
      * Created visually appealing and insightful dashboards to present findings and recommendations to 
        stakeholders.
      * Integrated Tableau dashboards with Power BI reports for a comprehensive view of the analysis results.
